# Project To-do List

> Just a to-do list on javascript using webpack.


The Todo list project comes after the student has learned about:

Objects
Factory Functions
The Module Pattern
And finally, after the introduction of a new lesson about OOP. The lesson shows the concepts of Single Responsibility and Tightly Coupled Objects.
